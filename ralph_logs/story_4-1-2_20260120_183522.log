Perfect! The implementation is complete. Let me create a summary of what was accomplished:

## Story 4-1-2 Completed: Shot Type Checklist

✅ **All acceptance criteria satisfied:**

1. **Checkboxes implemented** - Changed from radio buttons to checkboxes with proper visual indicators
   - ✓ Flat Lay Front
   - ✓ Flat Lay Back  
   - ✓ Ghost Mannequin
   - ✓ Hanging
   - ✓ Macro Detail

2. **At least one must be selected** - Validation ensures at least one shot type is selected before proceeding

3. **Each checkbox has icon and description** - Custom SVG icons and descriptive text for each shot type

4. **Default: all checked** - Initial state has all 5 shot types selected by default

### Key implementation details:
- Used `Set<string>` to manage multiple selections
- Toggle functionality to add/remove selections
- Button disabled state when no shot types selected
- Visual feedback with blue highlighting for selected items
- Responsive grid layout (1-2-3 columns based on screen size)
- Alert message shows which shot types will be generated

The shot type checklist page at `/generate/shots` now allows users to select multiple product shot types with proper validation and visual feedback.
