Perfect! Now let me verify the implementation is complete by checking all acceptance criteria:

## Completed Acceptance Criteria:

✅ **CityCard component exists with props: `city: City`**
- Created `/Users/greenmachine2.0/TMH/src/components/CityCard.tsx` with proper TypeScript interface accepting `city: City` prop

✅ **Card shows: city name, status badge, area codes, nickname count**
- City name displayed as heading
- Status badge with color-coded background (green for active, yellow for paused, gray for inactive)
- Area codes displayed as individual badges
- Nickname count shown prominently in the card footer

✅ **Cards display in responsive grid (1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3 col desktop)**
- Implemented using Tailwind CSS grid classes: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6`
- Mobile (default): 1 column
- Tablet (md breakpoint): 2 columns  
- Desktop (lg breakpoint): 3 columns

✅ **Clicking card navigates to `/cities/[cityId]`**
- Implemented `onClick` handler that uses Next.js router to navigate to `/cities/${city.id}`
- Added hover effects for better UX (shadow transition)

The implementation is complete with all acceptance criteria satisfied. The CityCard component displays all required information, the grid is responsive, and clicking navigates to the city detail page.
