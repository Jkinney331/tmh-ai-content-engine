Perfect! I've successfully updated the cityStore with all required CRUD actions. Here's what was completed:

## ✅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA COMPLETED:

1. **✅ `setCities(cities)` replaces cities array** - Already existed at line 17-18
2. **✅ `addCity(city)` appends to cities array** - Already existed at lines 20-25
3. **✅ `selectCity(id)` sets selectedCity to matching city or null** - Updated at lines 27-35 to accept an id and find the matching city
4. **✅ `updateCity(id, data)` merges data into matching city** - Updated at lines 37-51 to accept `data` parameter instead of `updatedCity`
5. **✅ `removeCity(id)` filters out matching city** - Renamed from `deleteCity` to `removeCity` at lines 53-63
6. **✅ `setLoading(bool)` and `setError(error)` work correctly** - Already existed at lines 65-66 and 68-69

All acceptance criteria have been satisfied. The store now has proper CRUD actions that:
- Replace the entire cities array with `setCities`
- Add new cities with `addCity`
- Select cities by ID with `selectCity`
- Update cities by merging data with `updateCity`
- Remove cities by ID with `removeCity`
- Manage loading and error states with `setLoading` and `setError`
