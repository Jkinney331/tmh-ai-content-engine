## Summary

I've successfully implemented the **AssetSelector** component for Story 4-3-3. The component has been created at `src/components/AssetSelector.tsx`.

### Acceptance Criteria Completed:

✅ **AssetSelector shows approved product and lifestyle shots**
- Component displays approved images by default (controlled by `approvedOnly` prop)
- Shows both product and lifestyle shot types from the generated images

✅ **Filterable by city, product, shot type**
- City filter dropdown allows selecting "All Cities" or specific cities (Seattle, Detroit, Chicago)
- Shot type filter includes: All Types, Lifestyle, Product, Street Style, Industrial
- Product tags are displayed when a specific city is selected

✅ **Multi-select for carousel formats**
- `selectionMode="multiple"` enables multi-select functionality
- Maximum selections configurable via `maxSelections` prop
- Selection counter shows X/Y selected
- Selected assets preview shown at bottom with reorder hint

✅ **Single select for single image formats**
- `selectionMode="single"` enables single selection
- Clicking an already selected image deselects it
- Only one image can be selected at a time

✅ **Selected assets shown with checkmarks**
- Selected images display blue CheckCircle2 icon
- Unselected images show empty Circle icon on hover
- Selected images have blue border highlighting
- Visual feedback with hover states and disabled states when max selections reached

### Key Features Implemented:

1. **Responsive Grid Layout**: Assets displayed in a responsive grid (1-4 columns based on screen size)
2. **Rich Metadata**: Each asset shows city, date, shot type badge, and approved status
3. **Selection Management**: Full state management for single/multiple selections with callbacks
4. **Preview Strip**: Multi-select mode shows selected assets in a preview strip with removal option
5. **Empty State**: Clear messaging when no approved assets are available
6. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper types from the existing types system
7. **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigable with proper focus states

The component integrates seamlessly with the existing TMH dashboard architecture, reusing existing components like `EmptyState`, utility functions like `cn`, and the mock data structure.
