Perfect! I've successfully implemented the export selection mode for the calendar page. Let me verify that all acceptance criteria have been met:

## Completed Acceptance Criteria:

✅ **"Export Mode" toggle adds checkboxes to content items** - When the Export Mode button is clicked, checkboxes appear in the top-left corner of each content item card.

✅ **"Select All" / "Deselect All" buttons** - These buttons are visible when Export Mode is active, allowing users to quickly select or deselect all content items.

✅ **Shows count: "X items selected"** - The selection count is displayed between the Select/Deselect buttons and the Export button, showing the exact number of selected items.

✅ **"Export Selected" button enabled when items selected** - The Export Selected button is:
   - Disabled (gray) when no items are selected
   - Enabled (blue) when one or more items are selected
   - Triggers a JSON file download containing the selected content data

## Additional Features Implemented:

- Visual feedback with blue ring around selected items
- Clicking on thumbnails in export mode toggles selection
- Export Mode button changes appearance when active (blue background)
- Automatic cleanup: selection is cleared when exiting export mode
- Export file includes comprehensive data: ID, content type, city, status, creation date, output URL, prompt, model, and metadata
- Export filename includes current date for easy organization

The implementation is complete and fully functional!
