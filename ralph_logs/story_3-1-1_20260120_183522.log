## Implementation Complete

All acceptance criteria have been satisfied:

✅ **Route `/generate` renders GeneratePage** - The route is working and accessible at `/generate`

✅ **CitySelector dropdown shows only approved cities** - The component filters cities by `status === 'active'` and displays them in a dropdown

✅ **Selecting city stores in generationStore** - The `setSelectedCity` action is implemented in generationStore and used by CitySelector

✅ **Shows "Select a city to begin" when none selected** - Both the CitySelector component and GeneratePage display this message when no city is selected

### Files Created/Modified:
- **Modified**: `src/stores/generationStore.ts` - Added selectedCity state and setSelectedCity action
- **Created**: `src/components/CitySelector.tsx` - Full implementation with city loading, selection, and display
- **Modified**: `src/app/generate/page.tsx` - Complete implementation with CitySelector integration and city information display

The implementation includes:
- Proper TypeScript types throughout
- Mock data fallback for when API isn't available
- Loading states
- Clear UI feedback for selected/unselected states
- Display of city details when selected
