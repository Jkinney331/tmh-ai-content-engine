Perfect! I have successfully implemented the product type selector. Let me verify the implementation meets all acceptance criteria:

## Completed Acceptance Criteria:

✅ **Radio group with options: Hoodie, T-Shirt, Hat** - Implemented a radio button group with all three product type options

✅ **"Hoodie" selected by default** - Set in the initial state of generationStore as `selectedProductType: 'hoodie'`

✅ **Selection stored in generationStore** - Added `selectedProductType` state and `setSelectedProductType` action to the store

✅ **Shows product icon for each option** - Each product type has its corresponding emoji icon (🧥 for Hoodie, 👕 for T-Shirt, 🧢 for Hat)

The implementation includes:
- A visually appealing card-based radio button selector
- Product icons displayed prominently
- Selected state with blue highlight and checkmark
- Hover effects for better UX
- The selected product type is displayed in the generation settings
- Responsive grid layout (3 columns)
