## Story 6-3-3 Implementation Complete

I have successfully implemented the prompt template test mode feature. Here's what was completed:

### ✅ All Acceptance Criteria Satisfied:

1. **"Test Template" button in editor** - Added in the header with TestTube2 icon
2. **Opens panel with variable inputs** - Full modal overlay with variable input fields for all types
3. **"Run Test" button generates preview** - Functional button with loading states
4. **Shows rendered prompt** - Displays template with variables replaced
5. **Shows Claude's response** - Shows actual response for text models or preview message for image models

### Files Modified:
- **src/components/PromptTemplateEditor.tsx** - Added complete test mode functionality
- **src/app/api/test-prompt/route.ts** - Created API endpoint for Claude integration

The test mode supports all variable types (text, number, select, color, boolean) and provides both real Claude responses (when API key is configured) and simulated responses for testing.
