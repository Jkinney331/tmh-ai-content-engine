Now let me verify the implementation summary:

## Implementation Complete: "Pick Winner" Feature

I've successfully implemented the "Pick Winner" buttons for the ComparisonViewer component with all requested acceptance criteria satisfied:

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria Completed:

1. **"Pick A" and "Pick B" buttons below each image** - Added buttons below each model's image with proper styling and positioning.

2. **Clicking highlights winner with border/checkmark** - When a button is clicked:
   - The winning model gets a green ring border (ring-4 ring-green-500)
   - A green checkmark badge appears in the top-right corner of the winning model
   - The button text changes from "Pick A/B" to "Winner Selected" with green background

3. **Stores winner selection in generationStore** - The winner selection is saved to the generationStore using the `selectWinner` action when a `comparisonId` is provided.

4. **Reveals feedback panel after selection** - A green feedback panel appears after selection showing:
   - Confirmation message with the selected winner
   - Option to continue comparing or close the viewer
   - Information that the choice has been saved (if comparisonId is provided)

### Key Implementation Details:

- Added state management for `selectedWinner` and `showFeedback`
- Integrated with the existing `useGenerationStore` hook
- Buttons are disabled until both images are loaded
- Responsive design maintained for mobile/desktop
- Visual feedback includes border highlighting, checkmark badge, and button state changes
- Feedback panel provides clear confirmation and next action options

The component now fully supports winner selection with proper visual feedback and state persistence.
