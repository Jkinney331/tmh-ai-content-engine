I need permission to create files. Let me wait for you to approve. Once approved, I'll create all the necessary migration files:

1. **001_create_cities.sql** - Creates the cities table (dependency for generated_content)
2. **003_create_designs.sql** - Creates the designs table (dependency for generated_content)  
3. **004_create_generated_content.sql** - Creates the main generated_content table for story 1-1-4

The generated_content table I've prepared includes:
- All required columns as specified in the acceptance criteria
- Proper foreign key relationships to cities and designs tables
- Check constraints for content_type and status enums
- Indexes for efficient querying by content_type, city_id, and status
- Row Level Security policies for authenticated access
- Automatic updated_at timestamp triggers
- Comprehensive column comments for documentation

Once you approve the file creation, I'll create all three migration files and then proceed to verify the table structure and test the INSERT/SELECT operations as required by the acceptance criteria.
