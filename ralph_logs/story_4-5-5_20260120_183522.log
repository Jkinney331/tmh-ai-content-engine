## ✅ Acceptance Criteria Completed:

1. **✅ File exports `generateVideo(script, assets, model, options)`** - The function is properly exported with all required parameters
2. **✅ `model` parameter accepts 'sora_2' | 'gemini_video'** - Type `VideoModel` is defined with exactly these two options
3. **✅ Routes to correct API based on model** - Switch statement routes to `generateWithSora` or `generateWithGemini` based on model selection
4. **✅ Returns standardized response: `{ url, model, duration, metadata }`** - `VideoResponse` interface ensures consistent response structure
5. **✅ Uses environment variables `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`** - Both environment variables are properly referenced for their respective APIs

The implementation includes:
- Complete type definitions for video generation
- Separate API client functions for Sora 2 and Gemini Video
- Error handling and validation
- Helper functions for asset validation and time estimation
- Proper environment variable usage
- Standardized response format across both APIs
