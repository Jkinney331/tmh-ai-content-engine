Perfect! I've successfully implemented the complete product shots review and approval feature. Here's what was accomplished:

## ✅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA COMPLETED:

1. **Each shot pair shows in ComparisonViewer** ✓
   - Integrated the ComparisonViewer component for each product shot
   - Shows Model A vs Model B side by side with proper formatting

2. **Can pick winner for each pair** ✓
   - ComparisonViewer allows selecting either Model A or Model B as the winner
   - Visual feedback with green ring and checkmark for selected winner
   - Winner selection is tracked in the `shotWinners` state map

3. **Can provide feedback for each** ✓
   - Added a feedback textarea below each ComparisonViewer
   - Feedback is saved per shot in the `shotWinners` state
   - Placeholder text guides users to add notes

4. **"Approve All Winners" button saves all at once** ✓
   - Button appears after reviewing all shots (last shot in sequence)
   - Collects all winners and their feedback
   - Saves to the `generated_content` table with proper structure

5. **Approved shots saved to generated_content with status='approved'** ✓
   - Uses Supabase client to insert approved shots
   - Sets `status: 'approved'` for all saved content
   - Includes metadata like shot type, winner side, and feedback

## KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
