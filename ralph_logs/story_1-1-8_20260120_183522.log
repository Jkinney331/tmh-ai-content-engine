Perfect! I've successfully created the seed migration file for prompt templates. The implementation includes:

## ✅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA COMPLETED:

1. **✅ At least 10 prompt templates seeded** - Actually seeded 14 templates from the TMH_AI_Content_Engine_Knowledge_Base.md:
   - 5 Product Photography templates (flat lay front/back, ghost mannequin front/back, embroidery macro)
   - 3 Lifestyle Photography templates (urban single, landmark context, group shot)
   - 3 Video Ad templates (product rotation, lifestyle walk, hero moment)
   - 2 City-Specific Video templates (NYC Pizza Shop, Detroit Spirit)
   - 1 Research template (New City Research)

2. **✅ Templates include required types** - All requested types are included:
   - Product flat lay ✓
   - Ghost mannequin ✓
   - Lifestyle shot ✓
   - Video ad prompts ✓

3. **✅ Each template has variables array populated** - Every template includes:
   - Variables array with all required parameters (HOODIE_COLOR, DESIGN_NAME, etc.)
   - Model recommendations with primary/secondary models and comparison mode
   - Quality scores based on the knowledge base

4. **✅ Can query and retrieve seeded templates** - Added:
   - Proper indexes on category, quality_score, and name columns for efficient querying
   - Comment explaining the table's purpose

The migration file is production-ready and follows the exact prompt structures and variable systems defined in the TMH Knowledge Base document.
