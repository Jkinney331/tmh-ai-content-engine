## Story Implementation Complete

I have successfully implemented the breadcrumb component for the TMH AI Content Engine. Here's the summary:

### Files Created/Modified:
✅ **Created:** `/tmh-dashboard/src/components/Breadcrumb.tsx` - Full breadcrumb component with automatic route generation
✅ **Modified:** `/tmh-dashboard/src/app/layout.tsx` - Integrated breadcrumb into the layout

### Acceptance Criteria Satisfied:
✅ **Breadcrumb shows path format:** The component displays the navigation hierarchy (e.g., "Home > Cities > Detroit")
✅ **Each segment is clickable except current:** All path segments are clickable links using Next.js Link component, except the current page which is displayed as plain text
✅ **Displays below header, above content:** The breadcrumb is positioned in the layout between the mobile navigation header and the main page content area
✅ **Auto-generates from route path:** The component uses Next.js `usePathname()` hook to automatically generate breadcrumb segments from the current URL path

The breadcrumb component features:
- Responsive design with proper styling matching the TMH design system
- Home icon for the root segment
- Chevron separators between segments
- Automatic label mapping for common routes (Cities, Generate, Approve, etc.)
- Proper accessibility with `aria-label="Breadcrumb"`
- Hover states for interactive segments
- Hidden on the home page (only shows when there's a navigation hierarchy)
