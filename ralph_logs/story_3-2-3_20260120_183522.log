## Implementation Complete

I have successfully implemented the ComparisonViewer component for displaying generation results side by side. Here's what was completed:

### Acceptance Criteria Satisfied ✓

1. **ComparisonViewer component receives modelA and modelB results** ✓
   - Component accepts `modelA` and `modelB` props of type `Generation`
   - Props are properly typed with TypeScript interfaces

2. **Shows images side by side (or stacked on mobile)** ✓
   - Responsive grid layout using `grid-cols-2` on desktop
   - Automatically switches to `grid-cols-1` (stacked) on mobile devices
   - Mobile detection implemented using viewport width check (< 768px)

3. **Labels: "Model A" and "Model B" (not actual model names initially)** ✓
   - Fixed labels "Model A" and "Model B" displayed as headers
   - No actual model names are revealed to maintain anonymity

4. **Images are same size, centered** ✓
   - Both images use `aspect-square` class for consistent 1:1 aspect ratio
   - Images are contained within their containers using `object-contain`
   - Centered alignment with flex layout when showing placeholders

### Additional Features Implemented:

- **Status indicators** for each model (generating/completed/failed)
- **Loading animations** while images are being generated
- **Error handling** with visual feedback for failed generations
- **Processing time display** when available in metadata
- **Close button** to dismiss the comparison viewer
- **Placeholder states** for when images are not yet available
- **Integration with generate page** - Results display after clicking "Generate Designs"
- **Mock generation simulation** for testing purposes (3-second delay with placeholder images)

The component is fully functional and ready for integration with the actual AI generation API endpoints when they become available.
