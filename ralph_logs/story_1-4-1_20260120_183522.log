## Implementation Complete

I have successfully implemented Story 1-4-1: Create app layout with sidebar navigation. All acceptance criteria have been satisfied:

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria Completed:

1. **Layout component wraps all pages in `src/app/layout.tsx`** - ✓ The layout component is created and properly wraps all pages with the sidebar and main content area.

2. **Sidebar with links: Cities, Generate, Content, Calendar, Library, Preferences, Settings** - ✓ All seven navigation links are implemented in the Sidebar component with proper routing.

3. **Each link has icon (Lucide icons) and label** - ✓ Each navigation item has a Lucide React icon paired with its label:
   - Cities: MapPin icon
   - Generate: Sparkles icon
   - Content: FileText icon
   - Calendar: Calendar icon
   - Library: Library icon
   - Preferences: Sliders icon
   - Settings: Settings icon

4. **Active route highlighted with different background color** - ✓ The active route is highlighted with blue background (bg-blue-50) and blue text (text-blue-700), while inactive routes have gray styling.

5. **Sidebar is 240px wide on desktop** - ✓ The sidebar is set to `w-60` which equals 240px (60 * 4px).

6. **TMH logo at top links to `/cities`** - ✓ The TMH logo is positioned at the top of the sidebar and links to `/cities` as required.

### Files Created/Modified:
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Main layout component with sidebar integration
- `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` - Complete sidebar navigation component
- All route pages created for testing (cities, generate, content, calendar, library, preferences, settings)
- Configuration files (tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.ts, postcss.config.mjs, next.config.ts)
- Updated package.json with proper scripts

The application is now running successfully with a fully functional sidebar navigation system that meets all requirements.
