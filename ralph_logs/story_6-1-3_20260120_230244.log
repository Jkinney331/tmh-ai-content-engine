## Completed Acceptance Criteria

✅ **Query feedback tags** - The component uses `supabase.rpc('get_feedback_by_tags')` to query all feedback tags from the database.

✅ **Count frequency of each tag with thumbs_up vs thumbs_down** - The component processes the data to calculate:
   - `thumbs_up_count`: Number of positive ratings for each tag
   - `thumbs_down_count`: Number of negative ratings for each tag
   - `positive_rate`: Percentage of positive feedback (thumbs_up / total)

✅ **Display as sorted list: "golden_hour: 85% positive"** - Tags are displayed with:
   - Tag name (formatted with spaces instead of underscores)
   - Percentage positive rating
   - Sorted by total frequency (most common tags first)

✅ **Color code: green for positive, red for negative patterns** - The component implements color coding:
   - Green (≥70% positive): Text and background in green shades
   - Red (≤30% positive): Text and background in red shades  
   - Yellow (30-70% positive): Text and background in yellow shades for mixed patterns

Additional features implemented:
- Visual progress bars showing positive percentage
- Thumbs up/down icons with counts
- Total count display for each tag
- Loading and error states
- Empty state when no feedback exists
- Legend explaining the color coding
