## ✅ Story 4-3-1 Complete: Create social content page

### Acceptance Criteria Satisfied:
1. ✅ **Route `/content` renders SocialContentPage** - The page is successfully rendering at `/content` route
2. ✅ **Shows list of available content types from database** - The page queries and displays active content types from the database using the `getContentTypes` function
3. ✅ **"Create Post" button for each content type** - Each content type card has a "Create Post" button that redirects to the generation page with the content type ID

### Implementation Details:
- Created a full-featured SocialContentPage component at `src/app/content/page.tsx`
- Added `content_types` table definition to the database types
- Added helper functions `getContentTypes()` and `getContentTypeById()` to the Supabase client
- Page features:
  - Loading state with spinner
  - Error handling with retry functionality
  - Empty state when no content types exist
  - Platform-specific icons and colors for better UX
  - Responsive grid layout (1-3 columns)
  - Content type cards showing name, description, format, and platform specs
  - "Create Post" button that navigates to generation page with content type parameters
  - Informational section explaining content types

The page is fully functional and integrates with the database to display available social media content templates.
