## Summary

I have successfully implemented Story 6-2-3: "Show prediction confidence on comparisons". Here's what was accomplished:

### Files Modified:
- **src/components/ComparisonViewer.tsx** - Enhanced with prediction confidence features

### Implementation Details:

1. **Added preference prediction logic**:
   - Integrated with `calculatePreferences()` function from lib/preferences
   - Checks if either model has > 70% win rate based on user history
   - Stores prediction in `modelPreference` state

2. **Visual indicator implementation**:
   - Shows a subtle purple badge with lightning icon
   - Displays text "You usually prefer this style" 
   - Only appears before user makes a selection (non-intrusive)
   - Positioned next to the model heading

3. **Prediction tracking**:
   - Tracks whether the prediction was correct when user selects a winner
   - Logs prediction accuracy data for future model improvements
   - Shows feedback message indicating if prediction was correct

4. **User experience**:
   - No auto-selection - just informative indicator
   - Feedback messages after selection:
     - Green message if prediction was correct: "Our prediction was correct! We're learning your preferences."
     - Yellow message if incorrect: "Thanks for the feedback! We'll improve our predictions."

### All Acceptance Criteria Satisfied:
- ✅ Shows indicator when one model has > 70% win rate for content type
- ✅ Displays subtle "You usually prefer this style" indicator
- ✅ Does not auto-select, only informs
- ✅ Tracks if prediction was correct for model improvement

The implementation is complete and ready for use. The feature provides a non-intrusive way to show users when the system has high confidence in their preferences while still allowing them full control over their selection.
