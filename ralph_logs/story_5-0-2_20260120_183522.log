## Summary of Completed Acceptance Criteria:

✅ **Filter dropdown: City (all cities + "All")** - Implemented with a dropdown that shows "All Cities" as the default option, plus all cities fetched from the database.

✅ **Filter dropdown: Content Type (product_shot, lifestyle_shot, social_post, video_ad)** - Implemented with a dropdown showing "All Types" plus the four specified content types: Product Shot, Lifestyle Shot, Social Post, and Video Ad.

✅ **Filter dropdown: Date range (Last 7 days, Last 30 days, All time)** - Implemented with a dropdown showing exactly these three options.

✅ **Filters update URL query params** - Implemented using Next.js router and searchParams. When filters change, the URL is updated with query parameters (city, type, range).

✅ **Grid updates when filters change** - The fetchApprovedAssets function is called whenever any filter changes (via useEffect dependency), and the query is modified based on selected filters to fetch and display the filtered results.

All acceptance criteria have been satisfied. The implementation includes:
- Three filter dropdowns for city, content type, and date range
- URL query parameter updates when filters change
- Dynamic filtering of the asset grid based on selected filters
- Active filter indicators with clear functionality
- Proper TypeScript types and error handling
