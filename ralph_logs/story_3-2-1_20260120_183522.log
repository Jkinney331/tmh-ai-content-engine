Perfect! I've successfully implemented the "Generate Designs" button with loading state for Story 3-2-1. Let me verify the implementation meets all acceptance criteria:

## Completed Acceptance Criteria:

✅ **"Generate Designs" button enabled when city, product, style selected**
   - The button is enabled only when `canGenerate` is true (which checks that `selectedCity`, `selectedProductType`, and `selectedDesignStyle` are all selected)

✅ **Clicking button shows loading state with spinner**
   - When clicked, `handleGenerate` sets `isGenerating` to true
   - The button displays an animated spinner SVG when `isGenerating` is true

✅ **Button disabled during generation**
   - The button's `disabled` prop is set to `!canGenerate || isGenerating`
   - Visual styling changes to gray/disabled appearance when disabled

✅ **Loading message: "Generating with 2 models..."**
   - The exact text "Generating with 2 models..." is shown alongside the spinner during generation

Additional features implemented:
- Clear visual feedback with different button colors for enabled/disabled states
- Helpful message shown when button is disabled explaining what needs to be selected
- Configuration summary shown when all required fields are selected
- Smooth transitions and hover effects for better UX
