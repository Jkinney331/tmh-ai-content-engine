## Story 4-5-6 Implementation Complete

I've successfully implemented the video review and approval feature with all acceptance criteria satisfied:

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria Completed:

1. **ComparisonViewer works with video** - Implemented side-by-side video comparison with play buttons and controls that match the UI from image comparison
2. **Pick winner button for videos** - Each video has a "Pick Winner" button that becomes "✓ Winner" when selected
3. **Feedback panel same as images** - Implemented identical feedback panel with:
   - Thumbs up/down buttons
   - Tag selection (Dynamic, Professional, Engaging, etc.)
   - Text feedback area
4. **"Approve" saves to generated_content with content_type='video_ad'** - The approve function saves videos with the correct content_type
5. **Shows "View in Library" button after approval** - After approval, displays success message with "View in Library" button linking to /approve

### Key Features Implemented:

- **Video playback controls**: Custom play buttons that show video controls when clicked
- **Video references management**: Uses useRef to control multiple video elements
- **Review mode navigation**: Navigate between videos with Previous/Next buttons and dot indicators
- **Gallery view**: Shows all generated videos with thumbnails and play buttons
- **Winner selection persistence**: Winners are tracked across navigation
- **Feedback system**: Complete feedback panel matching the image implementation
- **Responsive design**: Works on mobile and desktop layouts

The implementation follows the same patterns as the existing lifestyle page, ensuring consistency across the application.
