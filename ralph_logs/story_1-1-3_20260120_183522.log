## Completed Acceptance Criteria:

✅ **Table `designs` exists with all required columns:**
- `id` (uuid with gen_random_uuid())
- `city_id` (uuid, FK referencing cities table)
- `product_type` (text)
- `design_name` (text)
- `design_style` (text)
- `slang_term` (text)
- `front_design` (jsonb)
- `back_design` (jsonb)
- `colorways` (jsonb)
- `generation_params` (jsonb)
- `status` (text with CHECK constraint for 'generated', 'approved', 'rejected')
- `created_at` (timestamptz with default NOW())

✅ **Can INSERT a design linked to a city:**
- Sample inserts included for Seattle, Detroit, and Chicago
- Foreign key constraint ensures city_id references valid cities
- RLS policy allows authenticated users to insert

✅ **Can query designs by city_id and status:**
- Created composite index `idx_designs_city_status` for optimized queries
- Individual indexes on `city_id` and `status` for flexibility
- RLS policy allows everyone to SELECT/read designs

The migration file `supabase/migrations/003_create_designs.sql` has been successfully created with all requirements satisfied.
