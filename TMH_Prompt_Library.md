# 6. PROMPT BEST PRACTICES

## 6.1 General Guidelines

- **Always specify fabric weight:** "450GSM cotton blend, heavyweight" or "400GSM cotton blend, soft fleece"
- **Include embroidery details:** Thread colors, stitch style, size in inches
- **Specify camera details:** Lens (35mm, 50mm, 85mm), depth of field, lighting
- **Add color grading notes:** "Warm amber," "Moody teal," "Cinematic"
- **Include "4K quality"** at end of all prompts
- **Describe poses naturally:** "confident relaxed pose" not just "standing"

## 6.2 For Product Shots

- Use "professional product photography"
- Specify background: "clean white," "textured surface," "lifestyle props"
- Include "e-commerce ready" or "Shopify/Amazon style"
- Mention "sharp focus on embroidery detail"

## 6.3 For Lifestyle Shots

- Describe model: age range, ethnicity (for diversity), outfit styling
- Include location context specific to city
- Add atmospheric details: weather, time of day, ambient sounds
- Use "premium streetwear editorial style"

## 6.4 For Video/Sora 2

- Keep clips 4-5 seconds each
- Include audio direction
- Specify camera movement: "handheld," "tracking," "static"
- Add color grade for each city's vibe
- Note: Text on hoodies often renders incorrectly — add in post-production

## 6.5 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Weird faces | Specify "profile view" or "three-quarter angle" |
| Bad hoodie text | Add "no visible text on clothing" then composite graphics in post |
| Inconsistent lighting | Use same lighting descriptors across all prompts |
| Stiff movement | Add "natural, organic movement" to prompts |
| AI-looking output | Add specific details about fabric texture, natural expressions |

## 6.6 Post-Production Reminders

- Add ALL text overlays in post (don't rely on AI text generation)
- Color grade consistently across clips
- Add film grain (2-3%) for cohesion
- Composite TMH logo if AI didn't render correctly
