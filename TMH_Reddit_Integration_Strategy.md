# That's My Hoodie - Reddit Integration Strategy
## Community Engagement & Market Validation Playbook

---

## OVERVIEW

This document provides the complete strategy for using Reddit as a pre-production validation tool. Reddit serves three purposes:
1. **Market Validation** - Real feedback from target customers
2. **Brand Awareness** - Building buzz in each city's community
3. **Data Collection** - Understanding design preferences and sentiment

**Key Principle:** Reddit hates ads. Frame posts as genuine community engagement, not marketing.

---

## REDDIT POSTING STRATEGY

### Target Subreddit Research

Before posting to any city subreddit, research:

**1. Subreddit Rules**
- Check sidebar/wiki for self-promotion rules
- Some allow business posts with mod approval
- Others ban all commercial content
- Note: "Feedback Friday" or "Local Business" threads

**2. Community Culture**
- Read top posts from last month
- Note tone: formal vs. casual, supportive vs. critical
- Check average engagement (upvotes, comments)
- Identify what types of content perform well

**3. Optimal Posting Times**
- Analyze when posts get most engagement (use tools like Later for Reddit)
- Typical high-traffic times: 7-9 AM, 12-1 PM, 6-8 PM local time
- Avoid weekends in business-focused subs

**4. Moderator Relationship**
- Message mods before first post for approval
- Explain you're a local entrepreneur seeking feedback
- Show genuine intent to contribute to community
- Get explicit permission to post

---

## POST FRAMING STRATEGIES

### Strategy 1: Transparent Entrepreneur (RECOMMENDED)

**Tone:** Honest, humble, seeking genuine feedback  
**Works Best In:** Supportive city subs, startup subs  
**Example Post Title:**
```
"Local entrepreneur here - designing hometown pride hoodies for Seattle. Which design resonates more? 206"
```

**Post Body Template:**
```
Hey r/[CITY]! 

I'm a [YOUR_CITY] local working on a line of premium hoodies celebrating hometown pride. Before I commit to production, I'd love your genuine feedback.

[IMAGE: Side-by-side comparison]

**The concept:** High-quality hoodies that let you rep where you're from. Not tourist merch - more like a badge of pride for people who know.

**Which design speaks to you more?** Left or right? And why?

Any feedback (brutal honesty welcome) would be incredibly helpful. Thanks for keeping it real, [CITY]! 

---
*Note: Not currently for sale - genuinely just seeking input before production.*
```

**Why This Works:**
- Transparent about commercial intent
- Frames as "local" (builds trust)
- Asks for feedback, not sales
- Shows respect for community
- Disclaims not trying to sell yet

---

### Strategy 2: Stealth Community Poll

**Tone:** Curious, casual, anonymous  
**Works Best In:** Cautious subs with strict rules  
**Example Post Title:**
```
"Saw these Seattle hoodies online - which would you actually wear? Asking for a friend 👀"
```

**Post Body Template:**
```
Came across these [CITY] pride hoodie designs and I'm genuinely curious which one the city would vibe with more.

[IMAGE: Side-by-side comparison]

Left or right? Or neither? 

Curious what actual [CITY] people think vs. what some designer thinks we'd want.
```

**Why This Works:**
- No obvious commercial intent
- Feels like organic discussion
- "Asking for a friend" = relatable humor
- Creates debate/engagement

**Risk:** 
- Less authentic (can backfire if caught)
- Can't reference your business in replies
- Use sparingly

---

### Strategy 3: Design Feedback Request

**Tone:** Professional, seeking critique  
**Works Best In:** Design-focused subs, creative communities  
**Example Post Title:**
```
"[Feedback] Hometown pride hoodie concepts for Chicago - design critique wanted"
```

**Post Body Template:**
```
Working on a design project for [CITY] pride apparel. Two different approaches to representing the city - looking for honest design critique.

[IMAGE: Side-by-side comparison]

**Option 1 (Left):** [Brief description of design elements]
**Option 2 (Right):** [Brief description of design elements]

Design questions:
- Which feels more authentic to the city?
- Is the [LOGO ELEMENT] too literal or just right?
- Would you actually wear this or is it tourist-y?

Not looking for compliments - genuinely want to improve these before production. Thanks!
```

**Why This Works:**
- Frames as design exercise, not marketing
- Shows you value their expertise
- Specific questions = easier to respond
- Professional tone

---

### Strategy 4: Comparison Discussion

**Tone:** Conversational, debate-starting  
**Works Best In:** Active discussion subs  
**Example Post Title:**
```
"Settle a debate: Which captures Seattle's vibe better? Left or right?"
```

**Post Body Template:**
```
My friend and I have been arguing about which of these [CITY] hoodie designs better captures the city's vibe.

[IMAGE: Side-by-side comparison]

I think left feels more [CHARACTERISTIC], they think right is more [CHARACTERISTIC].

What does r/[CITY] think? Help us settle this!
```

**Why This Works:**
- Creates natural engagement (people love settling debates)
- Feels organic, not commercial
- Easy to respond (just pick a side)
- Can acknowledge your involvement in replies

---

## POST COPY TEMPLATES BY CITY

### Seattle Template

**Title:** "Which Seattle hoodie design hits different? ☕🌧️"

**Body:**
```
Hey r/Seattle! Working on hometown pride hoodies for the 206.

[IMAGE]

Before production, need real Seattle people's input (not some out-of-state designer's idea of what we want).

Feedback appreciated - trying to make something we'd actually be proud to wear, not tourist BS.
```

[IMAGE]

Left or right? Which one feels authentically Portland without being a cliché?

Looking for real Portlander feedback before going into production. Trying to make something locals would actually wear, not Powell's bookstore tourist merch.

- "PDX" (airport code used locally)
- "Keep Portland Weird" (slogan)
- Powell's reference (local landmark)

Need genuine [CITY] feedback before production. Not trying to make tourist crap - want something [CITY] locals would be proud to rock.

Honest opinions appreciated! [CITY_RELEVANT_EMOJI]
```

---

## COMMENT RESPONSE STRATEGY

### Golden Rules

1. **Respond to EVERY comment within first 24 hours**
2. **Be humble and grateful** (even to criticism)
3. **Never be defensive** (Reddit hates defensiveness)
4. **Add value** to the conversation
5. **Don't over-sell** (Reddit hates sales pitches)

---

### Response Templates by Comment Type

#### POSITIVE FEEDBACK

**Comment:** "Left one is fire 🔥"

**Your Response:**
```
Appreciate that! Left seems to be getting a lot of love. What specifically about it works better for you - the placement, the style, both?
```

**Why:** Shows you're genuinely interested in their opinion, not just collecting compliments.

---

#### CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM

**Comment:** "Both feel too busy. Simpler would be better."

**Your Response:**
```
That's really helpful feedback, thank you. Minimal/clean seems to be a common theme in the responses. Might need to strip it back even more. Appreciate the honesty! 🙏
```

**Why:** Acknowledges criticism gracefully, shows you're listening, doesn't argue.

---

#### NEGATIVE/HARSH CRITICISM

**Comment:** "These are ugly af, nobody would wear this"

**Your Response:**
```
Appreciate the honesty! That's exactly why I'm asking before production. Can you elaborate on what specifically doesn't work? Always looking to improve.
```

**Why:** Kills them with kindness, shows you welcome feedback, doesn't take it personally.

---

#### DESIGN SUGGESTION

**Comment:** "Right one is cool but the [ELEMENT] should be [SUGGESTION]"

**Your Response:**
```
Oh interesting! I actually hadn't thought of that angle. Would you mind if I DM you? Would love to get your take on a few variations.
```

**Why:** Makes them feel valued, opens door for deeper engagement, builds relationship.

---

#### PRICING QUESTION

**Comment:** "How much would these be?"

**Your Response:**
```
Still figuring that out TBH! Right now just focused on making sure the design is something people would actually want. Probably in the $[RANGE] range for premium quality, but haven't locked it in. Would that be in the ballpark you'd consider?
```

**Why:** Honest about being early stage, gives rough range, turns it into another question to gather data.

---

#### PURCHASE INTEREST

**Comment:** "Where can I buy this? I'd cop the right one."

**Your Response:**
```
Not available yet unfortunately - still in the design phase! But really appreciate you saying that. Would you be open to me DMing you when we go into production? No pressure, just want to let people who showed interest know when it's ready.
```

**Why:** Converts interest into future lead, doesn't spam the thread with sales talk.

---

#### SKEPTICAL/SPAM ACCUSATION

**Comment:** "This is just an ad disguised as feedback"

**Your Response:**
```
Fair concern! Reddit has a lot of that. I'm genuinely looking for input before production though - trying to avoid making something that flops. What would make you feel more confident this is legit feedback gathering vs. marketing?
```

**Why:** Acknowledges their skepticism, doesn't get defensive, asks how to build trust.

---

#### LOCATION-SPECIFIC CRITIQUE

**Comment:** "Nobody in Seattle actually says 'Emerald City' - that's tourist speak"

**Your Response:**
```
Damn, good call. That's exactly the kind of insider knowledge I need. What WOULD locals say? Just "Seattle" or is there a better nickname?
```

**Why:** Thanks them for local expertise, asks for solution, shows you care about authenticity.

---

#### OFF-TOPIC DERAILMENT

**Comment:** "Cool but hoodies suck in summer"

**Your Response:**
```
Ha! Fair point. These are definitely for the cold-weather cities. [CITY] winters made me want to create these.
```

**Why:** Brief, acknowledges their point, redirects to city context, doesn't over-engage.

---

## ENGAGEMENT TACTICS

### Voting/Poll Mechanism

**In Post Body:**
```
**Vote by commenting:**
- "Left" or "1" for left design
- "Right" or "2" for right design
- "Both" if you'd rock either
- "Neither" if both miss the mark

👇 Comments appreciated too but just voting helps!
```

**Why:** Makes it EASY to engage (low barrier), creates visible engagement (more comments = Reddit algorithm boost)

---

### Follow-Up Questions

After initial responses, add an edit:

```
EDIT: Wow, thanks for all the feedback r/[CITY]! 

Seeing strong preference for [WINNER]. 

Follow-up question: Would you prefer this on:
- Center chest (statement piece)
- Small left chest (subtle flex)
- Back between shoulders

Let me know! 🙏
```

**Why:** Keeps thread active, gathers more specific data, shows you're engaged.

---

### Transparency Updates

If you get good traction, update the community:

```
EDIT 2: Update for everyone who chimed in:

Based on feedback here, going to:
- Simplify [ELEMENT] (lots of you said too busy)
- Keep [PREFERRED_OPTION]
- Test [SUGGESTION from comments]

This community input is gold. Will post final version when ready. Thanks r/[CITY]! 🙌
```

**Why:** Shows you actually listened, builds goodwill, invites future engagement.

---

## SENTIMENT ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

### Automated Categorization (via Workflow 4)

**Sentiment Categories:**
1. **Positive** - "Love it", "Fire", "I'd buy this"
2. **Negative** - "Ugly", "Not feeling it", "Pass"
3. **Neutral** - Factual observations without emotion
4. **Question** - Asking for more info

**Design Preference:**
1. **Option 1** - Prefers left design
2. **Option 2** - Prefers right design
3. **Both** - Likes both
4. **Neither** - Dislikes both
5. **Unclear** - Doesn't specify

---

### Manual Review Flags

**Auto-flag for human review:**
- **Constructive criticism** with specific suggestions → High value
- **Local expert calling out inauthenticity** → Critical feedback
- **Purchase interest** → Potential customer
- **Influencer/high karma user** → Amplification opportunity
- **Negative with valid points** → Design flaw to address

---

### Sentiment Scoring Formula

```
Engagement Score = (
  (Positive Comments * 1.0) +
  (Questions * 0.8) +
  (Neutral * 0.5) +
  (Negative * 0.3)
) / Total Comments

Design Winner = 
  If Option_1_votes > Option_2_votes * 1.5 → Clear Winner Option 1
  If Option_2_votes > Option_1_votes * 1.5 → Clear Winner Option 2
  Else → Split Decision (test both)
```

---

## COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES

### Do's

✅ **Respond quickly** (within first 2 hours is ideal)  
✅ **Be humble and grateful** in all responses  
✅ **Acknowledge criticism** openly  
✅ **Use city-specific slang/references** naturally  
✅ **Upvote thoughtful comments** (shows appreciation)  
✅ **Ask follow-up questions** (deepens engagement)  
✅ **Give credit publicly** ("Great idea from u/username")  
✅ **Update the post** with findings  
✅ **Join the conversation** in other threads (build legitimacy)  

---

### Don'ts

❌ **Never argue or get defensive**  
❌ **Don't spam multiple subs same day** (Reddit notices)  
❌ **Never delete negative comments** (unless abusive)  
❌ **Don't over-promote** in comments  
❌ **Never use alt accounts to fake engagement** (bannable)  
❌ **Don't ignore criticism**  
❌ **Never claim "everyone loves it"** (dishonest)  
❌ **Don't post same image twice** in same sub (repost = spam)

## POSTING SCHEDULE & BATCHING

### Recommended Cadence

**Per City:**
- Maximum 1 post per week in city subreddit
- Wait 2 weeks minimum before second post
- If you get negative feedback, wait 4 weeks

## CONTINGENCY PLANS

### If Post Gets Removed

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Don't repost immediately
2. Message mods politely asking why
3. Review subreddit rules again
4. Wait for mod response

**If Mods Say "No Self-Promotion":**
- Respect it
- Ask if there's a weekly thread for local businesses
- Consider Strategy 2 (stealth approach) carefully
- Move to next subreddit

---

### If Post Gets Downvoted Hard

**Don't Panic:**
- Analyze comments for WHY
- Was it timing? Tone? Design? Framing?
- Learn and adjust

**Possible Reasons:**
- Post felt too "ad-like"
- Bad timing (wrong day/hour)
- Community had recent spam issues
- Design genuinely misses the mark
- Title was off-putting

**Recovery:**
- Thank commenters for honesty
- Don't argue
- Take feedback seriously
- Try different city with adjusted approach

---

### If You Get Accused of Spam

**Response Template:**
```
Understand the skepticism - Reddit has a lot of spam. I'm a [CITY] local (post history should confirm) genuinely looking for design feedback before committing to production. 

Happy to verify I'm legit if mods want to DM. Not trying to sell anything right now - literally just gathering input.

Appreciate you keeping the sub clean from actual spam though 🙏
```

**Then:**
- Back off from that sub
- Focus on building genuine participation history
- Consider getting mod pre-approval next time

---
